verify the tasks performed by the script as follows:

1. **Check User Accounts**: You can check if the user accounts were created successfully by using the `id` command:
    
    $id client1
    $id client2
    
    These commands should display the user and group information for `client1` and `client2` respectively.
    
2. **Check NGINX**: You can check if NGINX is running and enabled to start on boot with:
    
    $sudo systemctl status nginx
    s$udo systemctl is-enabled nginx
    
    The first command should show `active (running)` if NGINX is running. The second command should return `enabled` if NGINX is set to start on boot.
    
3. **Check SSHD**: You can check if SSHD is running and enabled to start on boot with:
    
    $sudo systemctl status ssh
    $sudo systemctl is-enabled ssh
    
    The first command should show `active (running)` if SSHD is running. The second command should return `enabled` if SSHD is set to start on boot.
    
4. **Check SFTP Configuration**: You can check the SFTP configuration in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file. Look for the lines added by your script:
    $grep -A1 "Match User" /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    This command access the sftp configuration for the user client1 and client2:
    $sftp client1@localhost
    
    This command should display the SFTP configuration for `client1` and `client2`.
